                            <ul>
                                <li>Developed a county-level heat map of the USA that ranked counties based on warehouse labor favorability. Ranking determined by a heuristic
                                    methodology that factored in macroeconomic labor conditions such as average wage, laborer supply and demand, and unemployment. Tableau tool was used to optimize placement of national distribution centers.
                                </li>
                                <li>Analyzed results and code of optimization model for video commerce client. Uncovered previously unnoticed duplication error that, when corrected, resulted in a $50M change in the projected sales from the model. Presented results to senior partner team.
                                </li>
                                <li>Created novel methodology for analyzing assortment optimization opportunity for retail clients. Analysis included creating a sales per exposure metric, creating a new sales vs profitability comparison to assess inventory policies, and uncovering unique features in the data to provide interesting cuts for the client. Analysis resulted in work that drove more than $15M of recurring savings. My "analyses [have] become the 'standard'" for teams in this area.

                        <div>
                            <p>Ciena is a global leader in optical and routing systems, services, and automation software. They sell hardware and software that, in short, forms the basis of internet connectivity across the globe. 
                                I worked inside of the project management team to liaise with engineers, sales teams, and business development groups in order to better position Ciena for the future. My projects included: </p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    Worked with results from experimental technology trial with multinational wireless carrier in order to deploy technology that utilized deep packet inspection (DPI) to slice network traffic and enable Verizon to customize prioritization of traffic through their network. 
                                </li>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>
                                    Created unique visualization of over 10,000 data points to understand packet loss behavior for TCP and UDP protocols. Identified flaws in the core technology and worked with engineering team to fix them.  
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                    Compiled final technical report to send to the wireless carrier team that included technical description, analysis of results, and potential areas for hardware and software improvement. 
                                    </li>
                                </ul>
                                <li>
                                    Synthesized data from sales and online sources to create sales prioritization framework for a novel technology. 
                                    Combined quantitative and qualitative data into a ranking that allowed me to group the target customers into 4 buckets.  Each of these buckets had a different likelihood of success, and each also dictated the type of sales strategy we had to employ.
                                    My work culminated in a presentation to sales team that directed their efforts towards the top 30 of over 300 potential clients.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Researched upcoming 5G auctions across the globe to create visualization that allowed sales team to understand when each country will be primed to buy Ciena's new 5G software. Work allowed Ciena
                                    to easily intercept investment opportunities.

                        <h2>Planalytics Inc.</h2>
                        <p>Planalytics is a SaaS company that helps its clients understand the impact of weather on retail demand. Planalytics uses advanced analytics and machine learning
                            to understand how a given day's weather will impact demand for each SKU in each store for national brands. Planalytics then plugs these insights into existing ERP systems in order to 
                            improve inventory forecasts and reduce waste and shrink. A core benefit of Planalytic's technology is waste reduction for their grocery store clients as improved forecasting leads to less waste.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Working directly under CEO Fred Fox, my role was to help Planalytics and their clients understand the associated carbon emission reduction stemming from the waste reduction. This would allow Planalytics to market to ESG groups inside large corporations and demonstrate an additional, non-monetary benefit of their technology.
                            In order to bring this idea from ideation to development to deployment, my team and I had to:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                Understand and pick one of the many different methodologies companies, governments, and scientists use to track carbon emissions.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Create our own quantitative algorithm to convert Planaytics' waste saving metrics into carbon emissions reduction figures.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Develop a product-market fit, business case, and sales deployment strategy that could be handed off to the sales teams in order to help attract and retain clients.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Ultimately, I presented my findings to the C-suite at Planalytics. After gaining their approval, I co-authored a industry "white paper" that was published and detailed the above information. It is attached below for download.</p>
