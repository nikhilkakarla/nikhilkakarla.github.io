                            <li>Developed a county-level heat map of the USA that ranked counties based on warehouse labor favorability. Ranking determined by a heuristic methodology that factored in macroeconomic labor conditions such as average wage, laborer supply and demand, and unemployment. Tableau tool was used to optimize the placement of national distribution centers.</li>
                            <li>Analyzed results and code of optimization model for video commerce client. Uncovered previously unnoticed duplication error that, when corrected, resulted in a $50M change in the projected sales from the model. Presented results to senior partner team.</li>
                            <li>Created novel methodology for analyzing assortment optimization opportunities for retail clients. Analysis included creating a sales per exposure metric, creating a new sales vs profitability comparison to assess inventory policies, and uncovering unique features in the data to provide interesting cuts for the client. Analysis resulted in work that drove more than $15M of recurring savings. My "analyses [have] become the 'standard'" for teams in this area.</li>

                            <li>Worked with results from experimental technology trial with multinational wireless carrier in order to deploy technology that utilized deep packet inspection (DPI) to slice network traffic and enable Verizon to customize prioritization of traffic through their network.</li>
                            <li>Created unique visualization of over 10,000 data points to understand packet loss behavior for TCP and UDP protocols. Identified flaws in the core technology and worked with engineering team to fix them.</li>
                            <li>Compiled final technical report to send to the wireless carrier team that included technical description, analysis of results, and potential areas for hardware and software improvement.</li>
                            <li>Synthesized data from sales and online sources to create sales prioritization framework for a novel technology. Combined quantitative and qualitative data into a ranking that allowed me to group the target customers into 4 buckets.

                        <p>Working directly under CEO Fred Fox, my role was to help Planalytics and their clients understand the associated carbon emission reduction stemming from the waste reduction. In order to bring this idea from ideation to development to deployment, my team and I had to:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Understand and pick one of the many different methodologies companies, governments, and scientists use to track carbon emissions.</li>
                            <li>Create our own quantitative algorithm to convert Planalytics' waste saving metrics into carbon emissions reduction figures.</li>
                            <li>Develop a product-market fit, business case, and sales deployment strategy that could be handed off to the sales teams in order to help attract and retain clients.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Ultimately, I presented my findings to the C-suite at Planalytics. After gaining their approval, I co-authored an industry white paper that was published and detailed the above information.</p>
